# Apple Human Interface Guidelines - macOS App Store Compliance

## Overview
This document contains essential Apple Human Interface Guidelines for macOS app development and App Store compliance, focusing on menu bar applications and design standards.

## App Store Compliance Requirements

### Sandboxing (Required)
```apidoc
macOS App Sandboxing:
- Required for apps distributed via the Mac App Store
- Enhances security by limiting app access to system resources and user data
- Protects against malware
- Configure using 'Configuring the macOS App Sandbox' in Xcode Help
```

### Developer ID Signing
```apidoc
Developer ID Signing (macOS):
- Sign apps with a valid Developer ID for distribution outside the Mac App Store
- Confirms app authenticity and safety
- Required for notarization
```

### Privacy Requirements
- Implement App Tracking Transparency framework if tracking users
- Provide clear privacy policy URL during app submission
- Request proper permissions for system resources
- Handle user data securely with encryption when needed

## Menu Bar Design Guidelines

### Menu Bar Structure (macOS)
```apidoc
macOS Menu Bar Components:
- Apple menu (leading side)
- App menus (application-specific)
- Menu bar extras (trailing side, custom items)
- Window controls (never in menu bar on macOS)
```

### Menu Bar vs iPadOS Differences
| Feature             | iPadOS                                     | macOS                                      |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Menu bar visibility | Hidden until revealed                      | Visible by default                         |
| Horizontal alignment| Centered                                   | Leading side                               |
| Menu bar extras     | Not available                              | System default and custom                  |
| Window controls     | In the menu bar when app is full screen   | Never in the menu bar                      |
| Apple menu          | Not available                              | Always available                           |
| App menu            | Limited (About, Services, visibility items)| Always available                           |

### App Menu Requirements
```apidoc
App Menu Standard Items:
- About _YourAppName_
  Action: Displays About window with copyright and version info
  Guidance: Use short name (â‰¤16 characters), no version number

- Settings...
  Action: Opens settings window or app's page in iPadOS Settings
  Guidance: Use only for app-level settings

- Optional app-specific items
  Action: Custom app-level configuration actions
  Guidance: List after Settings item, within same group

- Services (macOS only)
  Action: Displays submenu of system and app services
  
- Hide _YourAppName_ (macOS only)
  Action: Hides app and all windows, activates most recent app
  
- Hide Others (macOS only)
  Action: Hides all other open apps and windows
  
- Show All (macOS only)
  Action: Shows all other open apps and windows
  
- Quit _YourAppName_
  Action: Quits app (Option changes to 'Quit and Keep Windows')
```

## Icon Design Guidelines

### App Icon Design for macOS
```apidoc
macOS App Icon Requirements:
- Lifelike rendering style expected in macOS
- Cross-platform harmony with other platform versions
- Consistency across all platforms where app is available
- Use Icon Composer tool included with Xcode
```

### Menu Bar Icon Best Practices
- Use SF Symbols when possible
- Keep design simple and recognizable
- Ensure compatibility with both light and dark menu bars
- Consider accessibility and color contrast
- Use template images that adapt to system appearance

## Accessibility Guidelines

### Accessibility Requirements
```apidoc
Accessibility Features:
- Use Accessibility Inspector to identify interface issues
- Provide Accessibility Nutrition Labels on App Store
- Support VoiceOver navigation
- Ensure proper color contrast ratios
- Implement keyboard navigation
```

### VoiceOver Support
- Add meaningful accessibility labels
- Structure content hierarchically
- Provide accessibility hints for complex interactions
- Test with VoiceOver enabled

## App Store Marketing Guidelines

### Branding in App Store
```apidoc
App Store Branding:
- Consult App Store Marketing Guidelines
- Highlight brand identity within App Store
- Express branding in app icon and throughout app experience
- Multiple opportunities for brand expression
```

### App Store Assets
- Create compelling app screenshots
- Write effective app descriptions
- Use appropriate keywords for discoverability
- Provide localized content where applicable

## Design System Standards

### Color Guidelines
```apidoc
App Accent Colors (macOS 11+):
- System applies accent color when 'Accent color' setting is 'multicolor'
- User-selected accent colors override app's accent color
- Fixed-color sidebar icons retain specified color
- Design for both light and dark appearances
```

### Typography Standards
```apidoc
macOS Font Tracking Values:
- Point sizes from 6pt to 96pt supported
- Tracking values specified in 1/1000 em and points
- Based on 144 ppi for @2x, 216 ppi for @3x designs
- System fonts preferred for consistency
```

## Window and Panel Guidelines

### Panel Best Practices
```apidoc
Panel Usage:
- Provide quick access to important controls or information
- Suitable for inspector functionality
- Prefer simple adjustment controls (sliders, steppers)
- Brief, noun-based titles with title-style capitalization
- Show when app active, hide when inactive
- Don't include in Window menu's documents list
```

### Settings Window Guidelines
```apidoc
macOS Settings Window:
- Include settings item in App menu
- Avoid settings buttons in window toolbar
- Dim minimize and maximize buttons
- Use non-customizable toolbar that remains visible
- Update window title to reflect current pane
- Restore most recently viewed pane on opening
```

## Menu Organization
