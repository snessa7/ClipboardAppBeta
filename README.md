# ClipboardAppBeta 📋

> A lightweight, App Store-compliant menubar clipboard manager for macOS built with SwiftUI

## 🎯 Project Goals

Transform your existing clipboard app into a streamlined, App Store-ready **menubar application** with:
- ✅ **MenuBar-first design** with custom "v" icon
- ✅ Searchable clipboard history with real-time monitoring
- ✅ Sticky notes functionality optimized for menubar space
- ✅ Customizable user-defined tabs with flexible fields
- ✅ **Complete App Store compliance** (no screenshots/file downloads)
- ✅ Clean, native macOS design with system integration
- ✅ **User-defined development pace** (no fixed timelines)

## 🏗️ MenuBar App Architecture

### Core Design Principles
- **Pure utility app**: Lives exclusively in the menubar (no dock icon)
- **Custom "v" branding**: Distinctive icon for brand recognition
- **Minimal system impact**: Efficient background operation
- **Privacy-first**: Local storage only with encryption for sensitive data
- **App Store ready**: Built-in compliance with Apple's requirements

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Xcode 14.0+
- macOS 13.0+ (development) - **Required for MenuBarExtra**
- Apple Developer Account (for App Store distribution)

### Development Setup
1. Open the project plan: `PROJECT_PLAN.md`
2. Review technical specs: `TECHNICAL_SPECS.md`
3. Follow development checklist: `DEVELOPMENT_CHECKLIST.md`
4. Reference Apple documentation: `APPLE_HIG_COMPLIANCE.md`
5. Begin with menubar foundation and "v" icon creation
