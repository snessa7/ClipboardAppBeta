# Failure Documentation System

## ðŸš¨ IMPORTANT: This is a Production Business Application

**ALL failures, issues, and problems MUST be documented here.** This is not optional - it's critical for maintaining a production-ready application that serves real users and generates revenue.

## Quick Start

### When Something Goes Wrong:

1. **IMMEDIATELY** create a failure report using the template in `agents.md`
2. **Place it in the appropriate directory** based on severity:
   - `critical/` - Data loss, security, crashes (0-2 hour response)
   - `high/` - Performance, major bugs (2-24 hour response)
   - `medium/` - Feature bugs, UX issues (1-7 day response)
   - `low/` - Cosmetic, minor issues (next release)

3. **Update this index** with the new failure
4. **Create GitHub issue** for tracking
5. **Notify stakeholders** if critical

## Failure Report Template

Use this template for EVERY failure:

```markdown
## Issue Report: [Brief Description]

### Issue Details
- **Date**: [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM]
- **Severity**: [Critical/High/Medium/Low]
- **Component**: [Clipboard/Notes/AI Prompts/Custom Tabs/UI/Performance/Security]
- **User Impact**: [Description of how users are affected]

### Problem Description
[Detailed description of what went wrong]

### Steps to Reproduce
1. [Step 1]
2. [Step 2]
3. [Step 3]

### Expected vs Actual Behavior
- **Expected**: [What should happen]
- **Actual**: [What actually happened]

### Technical Details
- **Error Messages**: [Any error logs or messages]
- **Stack Trace**: [If applicable]
- **System Info**: [macOS version, device type, etc.]
- **App Version**: [Current app version]

### Root Cause Analysis

- **Contributing Factors**: [Additional factors that made it worse]
- **Prevention Measures**: [How to prevent this in future]

### Resolution
- **Fix Applied**: [Description of the fix]
- **Testing Performed**: [What tests were run]
- **Verification**: [How success was confirmed]
- **Rollback Plan**: [If fix fails, how to rollback]

### Lessons Learned
- **What Went Wrong**: [Key learnings]

- **Documentation Updates**: [What docs need updating]
```

## Business Impact

### Why This Matters:
- **User Trust**: Failures affect user confidence and retention
- **Revenue Impact**: Issues can lead to negative reviews and lost sales
- **Legal Liability**: Security failures can have legal consequences
- **Development Efficiency**: Proper documentation prevents repeat issues

### Success Metrics:
- **Zero Critical Failures**: Target for production releases
- **Fast Resolution**: <24 hours for high priority issues
- **Prevention Rate**: <5% repeat failures
- **User Satisfaction**: Maintain 4.5+ App Store rating

## Directory Structure

```
failures/
â”œâ”€â”€ critical/           # Critical failures (data loss, security, crashes)
â”œâ”€â”€ high/              # High priority failures (performance, major bugs)
â”œâ”€â”€ medium/            # Medium priority failures (feature bugs)
â”œâ”€â”€ low/               # Low priority failures (cosmetic issues)
â”œâ”€â”€ resolved/          # Resolved issues (moved after resolution)
â”œâ”€â”€ index.md           # Master index of all failures
â””â”€â”€ README.md          # This file
```

## Response Procedures

### Critical Failures (0-2 hours)
1. **Immediate Documentation**: Create failure report
2. **Stakeholder Notification**: Alert all relevant parties
3. **Mitigation**: Implement temporary fix if possible
4. **Root Cause Analysis**: Begin investigation
5. **Communication Plan**: Prepare user communication

### High Priority Failures (2-24 hours)
1. **Documentation**: Create failure report
2. **Investigation**: Root cause analysis
3. **Fix Development**: Create permanent solution
4. **Testing**: Comprehensive testing
5. **Deployment**: Release with monitoring

### Medium Priority Failures (1-7 days)
1. **Documentation**: Create failure report
2. **Planning**: Develop fix timeline
3. **Development**: Implement solution
4. **Testing**: Standard testing procedures
5. **Release**: Next scheduled release

### Low Priority Failures (Next Release)
1. **Documentation**: Create failure report
2. **Prioritization**: Add to development queue
3. **Development**: Implement when resources available
4. **Testing**: Basic testing
5. **Release**: Next release cycle
